# smells

Deterministic code-smell evidence for Rust, Python, and TypeScript.

`smells` scans a codebase and answers five practical questions:

1. What smell pattern was detected?
2. Where is it in the repository?
3. What measurement crossed which threshold?
4. Why might it matter, and what should be reviewed?
5. Which Refactoring.Guru reference must an agent research before suggesting a fix?

The scanner—not an LLM—decides whether a configured rule matches. The same
source, policy, evidence, and executable produce the same ordered JSON report.
This makes `smells` suitable for local review, CI, pre-commit hooks, and agentic
coding environments.

## At a glance

- Scans Rust, Python, TypeScript, and TSX source without executing application code.
- Reports repository-relative files, lines, symbols, measurements, and thresholds.
- Separates blocking rules from review-only signals.
- Understands monorepos and groups results by the nearest runtime manifest.
- Emits human-readable tables or complete JSON for hooks and coding agents.
- Ships versioned standalone binaries and binary Python wheels from one release build.
- Fails closed when parsing, required evidence, or analysis budgets are incomplete.
- Covers all 23 Refactoring.Guru smell categories through 28 rules per language pack.

> **Important:** every rule in every starter policy is active. The default group is
> `all`, so a scan without provider evidence intentionally exits `2` for rules that
> need compiler, type, coverage, contract, test, or Git-history facts. Use
> `--only-group source` for a source-only scan; excluded means “not checked,” never
> “clean.”

## Supported languages

| Language pack | Files scanned | Built-in source rules | Evidence-backed rules | What counts as a class-like type |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `rust-v1` | `.rs` | 17 | 11 | `struct`/`enum` state plus resolved inherent and trait `impl` methods; traits are interface-like contracts |
| `python-v1` | `.py`, `.pyi` | 10 | 18 | `class` state, direct methods, and `self`/`cls` field assignments |
| `typescript-v1` | `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, `.cts` | 10 | 18 | Classes, abstract classes, class expressions, method signatures, and constructor parameter-properties |

Java and Kotlin are not currently supported. A React Native repository can scan
its TypeScript/TSX source, but not its native Android code.

## Quick start

### 1. Install a release

Download the archive for your host from the matching
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/mindful-time/smells/releases). Verify both its
checksum and GitHub provenance before installing it. For macOS Apple Silicon:

```sh
gh release download v0.2.0 \
  --repo mindful-time/smells \
  --pattern 'smells-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz*'
shasum -a 256 -c smells-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz.sha256
gh release verify v0.2.0 --repo mindful-time/smells
gh release verify-asset v0.2.0 \
  smells-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz \
  --repo mindful-time/smells
tar -xzf smells-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
install -m 0755 smells-aarch64-apple-darwin/smells ~/.local/bin/smells
smells --version
```

The same release contains macOS Intel, Linux AMD64/ARM64 GNU, and Windows AMD64
archives. It also contains platform-specific Python wheels carrying the identical
Rust executable. After downloading the wheel for your platform:

```sh
uv tool install ./smells-0.2.0-py3-none-PLATFORM.whl
```

The wheel is a delivery mechanism; the scanner does not become a Python program.
There is deliberately no source distribution, so an unsupported platform fails
instead of compiling Rust unexpectedly. See the [release process](docs/release-process.md)
for the artifact contract and supported targets.

Contributors can still build from source with Rust 1.88:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mindful-time/smells.git
cd smells
cargo install --path . --locked
```

### 2. Choose a starter policy

| Your codebase | Starter policy |
| --- | --- |
| Rust | `examples/quality-policy.json` |
| Python | `examples/python-quality-policy.json` |
| TypeScript/TSX | `examples/typescript-quality-policy.json` |

A policy selects the language pack, rule modes, thresholds, excluded directory
names, default rule groups, and analysis budgets. There is no separate language
flag. Every starter has `"default_groups": ["all"]` and 28 active rules.

Copy the matching starter policy into the repository you want to scan. For a
Python project:

```sh
cp examples/python-quality-policy.json /path/to/python-project/quality-policy.json
cd /path/to/python-project
smells contracts validate --policy quality-policy.json
```

Use the Rust or TypeScript starter from the table in the same way. Review its
thresholds, then commit `quality-policy.json` with the project so local, CI, and
hook scans all use the same contract.

### 3. Scan a codebase

Use the table format for an interactive first run:

```sh
smells check \
  --path . \
  --policy quality-policy.json \
  --only-group source \
  --format table
```

Replace the path and policy for Rust or TypeScript. Scan from a monorepo root if
you want findings grouped by each nested implementation.

Use JSON for CI, hooks, or coding agents:

```sh
smells check \
  --path . \
  --policy quality-policy.json \
  --only-group source \
  --format json > smells-report.json
```

JSON reports can be large because they retain both matched and nonmatching
measurements so the verdict can be audited.

## Understand the result

### Exit codes

| Exit code | Meaning | What to do |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `0` | Every selected active required rule completed and passed | Continue |
| `1` | One or more required rules matched | Review the blocking findings |
| `2` | The scan was incomplete or invalid | Fix the input, policy, parser, ownership, budget, or evidence error |

Review-only findings do not change a successful exit code. Errors always take
precedence over matches.

### Read the table from top to bottom

An abbreviated table report looks like this:

```text
Implementation: backend | root: backend | ... | 120 python files
Smell pattern  | Pattern ID     | Result         | Matches | Blocking | Review | Coverage
Long Method    | long-method    | blocking_match | 3       | 3        | 0      | measured_defined_scope
Duplicate Code | duplicate-code | review_match   | 8       | 0        | 8      | measured_defined_scope
Dead Code      | dead-code      | excluded       | 0       | 0        | 0      | excluded

Matched evidence for backend:
Finding | Smell       | Repository symbols          | Metric                   | Value | Matches when | Threshold | Status    | Repository evidence locations
42      | Long Method | app/jobs.py::process_batch | authored body code lines | 146   | >            | 100       | violation | app/jobs.py:42:1
```

Read it in this order:

1. **Implementation** tells you which application, package, or service owns the result.
2. **Blocking** rows caused exit code `1` and should be handled first.
3. **Review** rows are deterministic signals that still require design judgement.
4. **Matched evidence** shows the exact symbol, measurement, threshold, and location.
5. **Excluded** means the resolved group selection did not run that detector; it
   does not mean no smell exists. **Disabled** is reserved for an explicit legacy
   `off` mode.

`checked_no_match_in_measured_scope` means the selected active detector ran and stayed
within its configured threshold. `not_applicable` means the smell does not map
to that language's model.

### Rule modes

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `required` | A match blocks with exit code `1` |
| `report` | A match is recorded for human or agent review but does not block |
| `off` | Legacy/custom-policy opt-out; the shipped policies do not use it |

### What a finding contains

Each matched JSON finding is self-contained. It includes:

- Smell name, category, pattern type, and rule identity.
- File, one-based line and column, symbol, and related locations.
- The observed measurement, comparison, and configured threshold.
- A source excerpt when applicable.
- Why the signal matters and what the reviewer should inspect.
- A behavior-preserving remediation direction.
- The exact Refactoring.Guru URL.
- A non-negotiable instruction requiring an external research call to that URL
  before an agent reviews or changes the code.

A shortened finding looks like this:

```json
{
  "smell_id": "long-method",
  "smell": "Long Method",
  "pattern_type": "metric",
  "symbol": "process_batch",
  "location": {
    "path": "src/jobs.py",
    "line": 42,
    "column": 1
  },
  "evaluation": {
    "metric": "authored body code lines",
    "observed": 146,
    "match_condition": ">",
    "threshold": 100,
    "matched": true
  },
  "diagnostic": {
    "why_it_matters": "A large callable can conceal multiple responsibilities and make focused testing harder.",
    "remediation": "Extract coherent steps into named callables or a focused class/module while preserving behavior with tests.",
    "reference_url": "https://refactoring.guru/smells/long-method",
    "reference_check": {
      "required": true,
      "non_negotiable": true
    }
  },
  "status": "violation",
  "blocking": true
}
```

See the complete [report interface](docs/report-interface.md) before building a
custom integration.

## Scan a working tree or the Git index snapshot

### Whole repository

```sh
smells check --path . --policy quality-policy.json --only-group source --format table
```

`--path` recursively captures only the selected language's supported extensions.
Configured cache/build directories are excluded by name. Symlinks are never
followed, so dependency caches cannot silently redirect a scan outside its root.

### Git index snapshot for pre-commit

Run this from the consuming Git repository:

```sh
smells check --staged --policy quality-policy.json --only-group source --format json
```

Despite the name, `--staged` does not scan only paths changed by the next commit.
It scans the complete tracked source snapshot in the Git index for the selected
language. It reads source, runtime manifests, policy, and optional evidence from
index blobs—not from unstaged working-tree replacements. The policy itself must
be staged.

For a mixed Rust/Python/TypeScript repository, keep one policy per language and
invoke the scanner once for each policy.

## Add it to a pre-commit hook

The repository includes an inactive [consumer hook example](hooks/pre-commit.example).
Pin and validate the scanner version before adding it to another project, and
merge the command into any existing hook rather than overwriting that hook.

A minimal single-language hook is:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu

command -v smells >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
  printf '%s\n' 'smells: scanner executable is unavailable' >&2
  exit 2
}

exec smells check --staged --policy quality-policy.json --only-group source --format json
```

Keep formatting, compilation, tests, Gitleaks, OSV, and other project checks in
the same quality pipeline. `smells` complements them; it does not replace them.
See [project integration](docs/project-integration.md) for mixed-language hooks,
scope guarantees, and fail-closed behavior.

## Monorepo behavior

When scanning from a monorepo root, each source file is assigned to its nearest
ancestor manifest:

- `Cargo.toml` for Rust
- `pyproject.toml` for Python
- `package.json` for TypeScript

The report gets one `implementation_results` section per discovered runtime.
Nested manifests take ownership from parent manifests. Source without a matching
manifest remains visible under `__unowned__` instead of disappearing.

This makes it possible to answer “which application or service owns this smell?”
without scanning every directory separately.

## Source rules and full-pattern evidence

The starter policies activate all 28 rules and select `all` by default. For an
immediate syntax-only pass, explicitly choose the `source` group:

```sh
smells check --path . --policy quality-policy.json --only-group source --format table
```

Built-in source rules cover deterministic syntax measurements such as:

- Function size and argument count.
- Class/type fields, methods, and total method lines.
- Repeated parameter groups and duplicate callable bodies.
- Comment density, data-only classes, and tiny classes.
- Additional Rust indicators such as primitive-heavy types, repeated dispatch,
  temporary fields, forwarding classes, and alternative interfaces.

Some smell claims cannot be made honestly from syntax alone. Dead code needs
compiler or type information; CRAP needs complexity plus complete coverage;
shotgun surgery and divergent change need pinned history; architectural smells
need dependency or project contracts.

All corresponding evaluators exist. Because the starter policy selects them,
the default full scan requires a complete provider-evidence bundle tied to the
exact resolved scan's `input_sha256`:

```sh
smells check \
  --path /path/to/project \
  --policy quality-policy.json \
  --evidence provider-evidence.json \
  --format json
```

Missing, stale, incomplete, or malformed required evidence returns exit code
`2`; the scanner never silently downgrades the rule. Start with the
[provider evidence guide](docs/provider-evidence.md) and its
[JSON Schema](schemas/provider-evidence.schema.json).

The bootstrap sequence is intentionally fail-closed:

1. Finish the full policy and capture a stable source snapshot. Staged mode is
   preferred because the Git index gives both passes the same source and policy.
2. Run that exact full policy without `--evidence`. The expected exit code is
   `2`, but the JSON report supplies the snapshot's `input_sha256`.
3. Run your pinned external providers against that same snapshot and create one
   complete evidence entry for every selected provider-backed rule, using that
   digest.
4. Stage the evidence file when using `--staged`, then rerun the command with
   `--evidence provider-evidence.json`.

Do not change source or policy between these steps. If anything changes, capture
a new digest and regenerate the evidence.

## Policies and rule reference

### Choose which policy groups run

The selection model follows uv's dependency-group behavior. Persistent defaults
come from `default_groups` in the checked-in policy; the starter policies use
`["all"]`. Inspect the exact resolved policy before scanning:

```sh
smells policy show --policy quality-policy.json --format table
smells policy show --policy quality-policy.json --only-group source --format json
```

Built-in groups are `all`, `source`, `evidence`, and the five canonical smell
categories: `bloaters`, `object-orientation-abusers`, `change-preventers`,
`dispensables`, and `couplers`.

| Selector | Resolution behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--group NAME` | Add a group to the configured defaults; repeatable |
| `--only-group NAME` | Replace defaults with only these groups; repeatable |
| `--all-groups` | Include every rule |
| `--no-default-groups` | Start without configured defaults |
| `--no-group NAME` | Remove a group after every inclusion; exclusions always win |

`--only-group` conflicts with `--group`, `--all-groups`, and
`--no-default-groups`. Unknown or duplicate group selectors return exit `2`.
The resolved selection, group membership, selected/excluded rule IDs, and rule
mode appear in `policy show` and every scan report. The resolved selection is
also part of `input_sha256`, so evidence for one selection cannot be replayed
against another.

List the registered rules for one language pack:

```sh
smells rules --rule-pack rust-v1
smells rules --rule-pack python-v1
smells rules --rule-pack typescript-v1
```

Exact thresholds and measurement contracts are documented here:

- [Rust rule contracts](docs/rust-rule-contracts.md)
- [Python rule contracts](docs/python-rule-contracts.md)
- [TypeScript rule contracts](docs/typescript-rule-contracts.md)
- [Report interface](docs/report-interface.md)
- [Provider evidence](docs/provider-evidence.md)
- [Project integration](docs/project-integration.md)

Analysis limits such as `maximum_files`, `maximum_pairs`, and
`maximum_group_combinations` are deterministic safety ceilings. Exceeding a
limit returns exit code `2`; it never produces a silently truncated success.

## What `smells` does not do

- It does not automatically fix or refactor source code.
- It does not execute application code, builds, compilers, tests, or build scripts.
- It does not treat a structural indicator as proof of a design defect.
- It does not guess active Rust features, Python environments, or TypeScript configs.
- It does not authenticate external evidence producers; the surrounding quality
  pipeline must invoke and verify the intended pinned provider.
- It does not currently scan Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, JSX, or other languages.

The tool supplies deterministic evidence. A human or coding agent still decides
whether the detected structure is intentional and which behavior-preserving
change, if any, is appropriate.

## Performance and benchmarking

Python and TypeScript parsing uses bounded Rayon workers. Duplicate detection
uses exact prefix, size, and positional filters before charging the pair budget,
avoiding comparisons that cannot reach the configured similarity threshold.

Measure your own repository instead of assuming one machine or corpus represents
another:

```sh
./scripts/benchmark-scan.sh . quality-policy.json 5 cold default
./scripts/benchmark-scan.sh . quality-policy.json 5 warm default
```

The benchmark discards the report but records wall time, cache hits/misses,
syntax work, candidate comparisons, output bytes, and peak memory. Always compare
cold and warm results; cache hits are deterministic but are not guaranteed to be
faster for every corpus. See [performance and algorithm research](docs/performance-algorithm-research.md)
for the algorithm and benchmark design.

## Developing `smells`

Run the deterministic test suite:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
```

Install this repository's own pre-commit and pre-push hooks:

```sh
make install-hooks
make pre-commit-push
```

The shared gate runs formatting, build, Clippy, tests, the scanner against
itself, CRAP analysis, Gitleaks, and OSV. CRAP has a target of `5` and a hard
blocking limit of `10`; scores above the target remain visible to coding agents.

Pull requests run that same gate in GitHub Actions and additionally build, install,
and execute a binary wheel and standalone archive. Pull requests must originate
from a fork. Only repository owner `mindful-time` can dispatch release publication
from `main`; read
[repository governance](docs/repository-governance.md) and the
[release process](docs/release-process.md) before changing either workflow.

The optional live E2E test verifies the hook-to-finding-to-Refactoring.Guru
research path and therefore requires network access:

```sh
cargo test --locked --test e2e_live -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Ordinary tests remain offline and deterministic.

## Project status

`smells` is currently version `0.2.0`. GitHub Release archives are the canonical
distribution; binary Python wheels are attached to the same release. The crate is
not published to crates.io, no sdist is produced, and no open-source license file is
currently included, so do not assume permission to copy, modify, or redistribute it.
Repository:
[mindful-time/smells](https://github.com/mindful-time/smells).
