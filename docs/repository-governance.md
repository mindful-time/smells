# Repository governance

## Intended `main` policy

`main` is owner-maintained and pull-request-only:

- `mindful-time` is the only account with write or administration permission.
- Outside contributors work from forks and open pull requests.
- Required CI rejects a pull request when its head branch is in this repository
  instead of a fork, including a same-repository pull request opened by the owner.
  Historical PR #1 has an exact owner-and-branch-bound bootstrap exception because
  it introduced this rule before branch protection was enabled. A merged pull
  request cannot be reopened, and no later pull request can match its number.
- Direct pushes, force pushes, and branch deletion are blocked for everyone,
  including the owner.
- The branch must be current with `main`, have resolved conversations, use linear
  history, and pass the `required` CI status before merge.
- Zero approving reviews are required because GitHub does not allow an author to
  approve their own pull request. The owner remains the only account able to merge.

`.github/CODEOWNERS` records ownership. Enforcement comes from branch protection,
not from the CODEOWNERS file or local Git hooks.

## Enforced GitHub settings

The repository is public so GitHub can enforce this policy without requiring a
paid private-repository plan. It still has exactly one collaborator with write
access: `mindful-time`. Apply or audit the checked-in branch-protection rule with:

```sh
./scripts/configure-main-protection.sh mindful-time/smells
```

Then inspect the resulting settings in GitHub and confirm a direct owner push is
rejected. Also confirm that a same-repository pull request fails the fork-origin CI
check. GitHub branch protection has no native fork-origin setting; the required CI
check supplies that policy. The script enables administrator enforcement and does
not configure an owner bypass.

The release workflow independently rejects dispatches and reruns from every actor
other than `mindful-time`, even if another writer is added later. It repeats the
check immediately before publication. Immutable releases lock each published
release's tag and assets.
